Description: Performs brace expansions on strings.  Made popular by Unix shells, brace expansion allows users to concisely generate certain character vectors by taking a single string and (recursively) expanding the comma-separated lists and double-period-separated integer and character sequences enclosed within braces in that string.  The double-period-separated numeric integer expansion also supports padding the resulting numbers with zeros.
